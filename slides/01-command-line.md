#Introduction to the Command Line  

---

This lesson is to get you comfortable with the command line and give you an idea of what some of what it can do. 

--

Most of these commands have many more options, and are more powerful than the simple examples here.  

--

They are commands I've found useful, and is by no means an exhaustive list.  

--

**Instructions**  
To follow along copy and paste 
```
curl -LOk https://github.com/andrewquitadamo/programming-spring2017/archive/master.zip \  
&& unzip master.zip && cd programming-spring2017-master/data/
``` 
into your terminal.

##Moving Around   

--

###pwd  
Prints path of current directory:  
```
pwd  
```  
--

**Instructions**  
Use `pwd` in your current directory.  
The results should look something like:  

```
/Users/andrewquitadamo/Development/repos/programming-fall2017/data/
```  

---

###ls  
List contents of current directory:  
```
ls
```

--

List contents of current directory and size:  
```
ls -s
```  

--

List contents of current directory with permissions, size, and date modified:  
```
ls -l
```

List  contents of current directory sorted by date modified:  
```
ls -t
```  

--

Reverse the results:  
```
ls -r
```  

--

Show all files and directories, including hidden ones:  
```
ls -a
```  

---

###ls (cont.)

These options can be combined together. For example to list all the contents of a directory by time, in the long format, and reversed you would use `ls -altr`.  

--

**Instructions**  
Use `ls` in your current directory. 
The results should look like `SV_gene_sample SV_pos miRNA.tar.gz`.  

---

###mkdir
Creates new directory  
```
mkdir directory_name
```  

--

**Instructions**
